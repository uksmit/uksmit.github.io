# Setup

Today, I am writing this blog from the Linux terminal using Vim.

This will take some getting used to, so I have [Vim cheatsheet](https://vim.rtorr.com/) on standby.
**Note:** Just figuring out how to paste the URL for the above hyperlink was a struggle: `ctrl+shift+V` does the trick.

# Linux

This is all part of me experimenting with Linux via a Chromebook.
I am trying to do things terminal-first, such as simple file manipulation:

| Alias        | Command      | Action      |
|:-------------|:-------------|:------------|
| ls           | list         | List files  |
| touch        | touch        | New file    |
| cat          | concatenate  | Read file   |
| cp           | copy         | Copy file   |

# Git

These will also be my first commits on this setup to my GitHub account.
I have previously committed from directly within the GitHub editor.
This required me to configure account authorisation, so for the time being I am using a Personal Access Token.
